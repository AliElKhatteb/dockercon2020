## Jim's DockerCon 2020 Snyk Demo Walkthrough

Thank you for checking out this repository!

At DockerCon 2020 I will be doing some demos, showing folks a process for getting vulnerabilities out of their container images. I'll be posting my demo steps, Dockerfiles, and everything else you need to do your own hands-on work with the process.

[See my session at 3:30 pacific time on May 28](https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/content/Videos/GZpzJAapdrSXohzNz)

In the meantime, [Snyk is available for free](https://snyk.io/signup) if you want to play around.

Now here's a random picture of a Doberman, just for grins:
