## Jim's DockerCon 2020 Snyk Demo Walkthrough

Thank you for checking out this repository!

At DockerCon 2020 I will be doing some demos, showing folks a process for getting vulnerabilities out of their container images. I'll be posting my demo steps, Dockerfiles, and everything else you need to do your own hands-on work with the process.

In the meantime, Snyk is available for free if you want to play around.

And here's a random picture of a Doberman, just because:
